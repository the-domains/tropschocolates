# Chocolates

## Almond Creme

A fragrant almond paste, similar to European-­‐styled marzipan, wrapped in either milk or dark chocolate and topped with an almond sliver.

## Maple Crème

A sweet brown sugar center with the consistency of cookie dough dipped in milk or dark chocolate.

## Raspberry Crème

An enticing combo of sweet and tart, we cra? this piece from our home-made raspberry jam using real, fresh berries. The center of this piece is a brilliant magenta with real seeds, not a gel, encased in milk or dark chocolate.
